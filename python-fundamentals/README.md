## Python Fundamentals for Bioinformatics

Selected assignments from coursework demonstrating core Python
programming concepts applied to biological data analysis and
bioinformatics workflows.

### Topics Covered
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Loops, conditionals, and functions
- File I/O (text, CSV, FASTA, XML)
- Command-line argument handling
- Basic statistical summaries
- Introductory use of Biopython and BLAST automation

### Highlighted Project
- **MS/MS Peptide Fragment Ion Annotator**  
  A Python script that parses mzXML files, computes theoretical b and y ions
  for a given peptide sequence, matches them to experimental MS/MS spectra,
  and visualizes annotated fragment ions using matplotlib.
